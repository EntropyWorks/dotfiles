This is my bash stuff to make working with the multiple AZ productive.

DO NOT RUN ./install.sh unless you want to link your .bash* file to 
the ones located where this has been checked out.  

You will need to create a .bash_cloud_secrets based on the bash_cloud_secrets
file here. Do not modify the bash_cloud_secrets and link back to it. That 
way we don't check in those passwords into git.
